- non-grid based movement
- movement heuristics dependent on token actor intelligence/type etc.
  - smarter enemies try to not get in each other's way, optimize encircle or cut off exits
  - dumb enemies block each other, get stuck, take inefficient paths
- prevent simultaneous occupation during movement
  - insert ghost stops to let token pass
- ease movement
- order determined by initiative, speed and distance from target
- adjust movement animation based on speed
- alternative search algorithms (A*, Î˜*, SIPP)
- look at extended animations
  - rotate in movement direction
  - movement styles (sharp, smooth, fluttery, stomping...)
